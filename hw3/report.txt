BFS
    Average steps: 26.987
    %success: 77
    strengths: tends to find *a* path more often than some competitors
    weaknesses: takes a hot while to get there, not optimized for anything
                except looking  at every element in a predetermined order

DFS
    avg steps: 17.815
    %success: 65
    strengths: less work than BFS when it works
    weaknesses: less success than BFS, lack of optimization, it simply looks
                at everything in a specific order as opposed to making informed
                decisions

UCS
    does not run as of yet

Greedy
    avg steps: almost always 10, which is the absolute minimum
    success: a smidgen over 50%
    strengths: when it works, it REEEAAAALLY works
    weaknesses: gets in its own way, gets stuck in loops like half of the time
