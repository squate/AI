Migos adlibs to text
	pay attention to rhythm?
	know when a phrase ends?
	
"Swoocin' right into the game" --> "Swoocin' right into the game (SWOOCE)"

	sounds associated with concepts, situations, objects, vibe(?)
	

	what part of phrase to adlib?
		could depend on mode:
			humor; hard; rich; onamot 
			isolate vibe, let that inform wselection process
	default to most satisfying word stated, maybe variaton of it
	"Friends with the dog in the bush"
		- [dog noise]-look up list of dog noises, find one with similiar vowels
		- foliage!
		- friends
		- and, as always, skrrt

variable that sets probablility of defaulting to a generic adlib (ex: skrrt, gun noise, ay, ya)

turn text into phrases that sound good,
	for each phrase, find a word to say that like makes sense but comes from left field
